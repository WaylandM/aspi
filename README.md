#Analysis of Symmetry of Parasitic Infections (ASPI)
When parasites invade paired structures of their host non-randomly, the resulting asymmetry may have both pathological and ecological significance. To facilitate the detection and visualization of asymmetric infections we have developed a free web application, ASPI, using [R](http://www.r-project.org) and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/):

ASPI can detect both consistent bias towards one side, and inconsistent bias in which the left side is favored in some hosts and the right in others.
