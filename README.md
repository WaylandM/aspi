#Analysis of Symmetry of Parasitic Infections (ASPI)
ASPI is a tool for the detection and visualization of asymmetry in parasitic infections, implemented using [R](http://www.r-project.org) and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/). ASPI can detect both consistent bias towards one side, and inconsistent bias in which the left side is favored in some hosts and the right in others.

A free web application is available:

[https://wayland.shinyapps.io/aspi](https://wayland.shinyapps.io/aspi)

You can also [run the web application on your own computer](https://github.com/WaylandM/aspi/blob/master/doc/running_locally.md) or [call ASPIs functions from the command line](https://github.com/WaylandM/aspi/blob/master/doc/cli.md).
