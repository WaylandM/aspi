#Analysis of Symmetry of Parasitic Infections (ASPI)
ASPI is a tool for the detection and visualization of asymmetry in parasitic infections, implemented using [R](http://www.r-project.org) and [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/). ASPI can detect both consistent bias towards one side, and inconsistent bias in which the left side is favored in some hosts and the right in others.

A free web application is available:

ASPIs functions can also be called from the command line.
