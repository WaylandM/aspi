#Examples

Here are examples of the results ASPI returns under different scenarios. Simulated data sets have been generated for parasitic infections showing: 

1. symmetry 
2. left bias with the left:right ratio varying between hosts
3. left bias with left:right ratio similar in all hosts
4. asymmetry with inconsistent bias (left bias in some hosts and right in others)

##Symmetry
Simulated data file: [simulated_symmetrical_infection.csv](https://github.com/WaylandM/aspi/blob/master/data/parasites/simulated_symmetrical_infection.csv)

|Host Accession Number 	|left 	|right|
--------------------------------------
|1 	|86 	|89|
|2 	|96 	|112|
|3 	|92 	|88|
|4 	|112 	|104|
|5 	|90 	|109|
|6 	|117 	|96|
|7 	|98 	|97|
|8 	|106 	|91|
|9 	|81 	|118|
|10 	|84 	|102|
