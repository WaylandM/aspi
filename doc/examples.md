#Examples

Here are examples of the results ASPI returns under different scenarios. Simulated data sets have been generated for parasitic infections showing: 

1. [symmetry](#symmetry) 
2. [left bias with the left:right ratio varying between hosts](#left-bias-heterogeneous)
3. [left bias with left:right ratio similar in all hosts](#left-bias-homogeneous)
4. [asymmetry with inconsistent bias left bias in some hosts and right in others](#asymmetry-with-inconsistent-bias)
