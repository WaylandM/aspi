#Examples

Here are examples of the results ASPI returns under different scenarios. Simulated data sets have been generated for parasitic infections showing: 

1. symmetry 
2. left bias with the left:right ratio varying between hosts
3. left bias with left:right ratio similar in all hosts
4. asymmetry with inconsistent bias (left bias in some hosts and right in others)

##Symmetry
Data: [simulated_symmetrical_infection.csv](https://github.com/WaylandM/aspi/blob/master/data/parasites/simulated_symmetrical_infection.csv)

##Left bias with left:right ratio varying between hosts

##Left bias with left:right ratio similar in all hosts


##Asymmetry with inconsistent bias
