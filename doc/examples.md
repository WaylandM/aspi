#Examples

Here are examples of the results ASPI returns under different scenarios. Simulated data sets have been generated for parasitic infections showing (1) symmetry; (2) left bias with the left:right ratio varying between hosts; (3) left bias with left:right ratio similar in all hosts; and (4) asymmetry with inconsistent bias (left bias in some hosts and right in others).
